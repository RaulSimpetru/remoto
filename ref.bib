abstract = {A Web-based simulation system of the spinal cord circuitry responsible for muscle control is described. The simulator employs two-compartment motoneuron models for S, FR and FF types, with synaptic inputs acting through conductance variations. Four motoneuron pools with their associated interneurons are represented in the simulator, with the possibility of inclusion of more than 2,000 neurons and 2,000,000 synapses. Each motoneuron action potential is followed, after a conduction delay, by a motor unit potential and a motor unit twitch. The sums of all motor unit potentials and twitches result in the electromyogram (EMG), and the muscle force, respectively. Inputs to the motoneuron pool come from populations of interneurons (Ia reciprocal inhibitory interneurons, Ib interneurons, and Renshaw cells) and from stochastic point processes associated with descending tracts. To simulate human electrophysiological experiments, the simulator incorporates external nerve stimulation with orthodromic and antidromic propagation. This provides the mechanisms for reflex generation and activation of spinal neuronal circuits that modulate the activity of another motoneuron pool (e.g., by reciprocal inhibition). The generation of the H-reflex by the Ia-motoneuron pool system and its modulation by spinal cord interneurons is included in the simulation system. Studies with the simulator may include the statistics of individual motoneuron or interneuron spike trains or the collective effect of a motor nucleus on the dynamics of muscle force control. Properties associated with motor-unit recruitment, motor-unit synchronization, recurrent inhibition and reciprocal inhibition may be investigated.},

@article{Elias2012,
abstract = {Motoneuron (MN) dendrites may be changed from a passive to an active state by increasing the levels of spinal cord neuromodulators, which activate persistent inward currents (PICs). These exert a powerful influence on MN behavior and modify the motor control both in normal and pathological conditions. Motoneuronal PICs are believed to induce nonlinear phenomena such as the genesis of extra torque and torque hysteresis in response to percutaneous electrical stimulation or tendon vibration in humans. An existing large-scale neuromuscular simulator was expanded to include MN models that have a capability to change their dynamic behaviors depending on the neuromodulation level. The simulation results indicated that the variability (standard deviation) of a maintained force depended on the level of neuromodulatory activity. A force with lower variability was obtained when the motoneuronal network was under a strong influence of PICs, suggesting a functional role in postural and precision tasks. In an additional set of simulations when PICs were active in the dendrites of the MN models, the results successfully reproduced experimental results reported from humans. Extra torque was evoked by the self-sustained discharge of spinal MNs, whereas differences in recruitment and de-recruitment levels of the MNs were the main reason behind torque and electromyogram (EMG) hysteresis. Finally, simulations were also used to study the influence of inhibitory inputs on a MN pool that was under the effect of PICs. The results showed that inhibition was of great importance in the production of a phasic force, requiring a reduced co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. These results show the richness of functionally relevant behaviors that can arise from a MN pool under the action of PICs.},

@article{Watanabe2013,
abstract = {This study focuses on neuromuscular mechanisms behind ankle torque and EMG variability during a maintained isometric plantarflexion contraction. Experimentally obtained torque standard deviation (SD) and soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) EMG envelope mean and SD increased with mean torque for a wide range of torque levels. Computer simulations were performed on a biophysically-based neuromuscular model of the triceps surae consisting of premotoneuronal spike trains (the global input, GI) driving the motoneuron pools of the SOL, MG and LG muscles, which activate their respective muscle units. Two types of point processes were adopted to represent the statistics of the GI, Poisson and Gamma. Simulations showed a better agreement with experimental results when the GI was modeled by Gamma point processes having lower orders (higher variability) for higher target torques. At the same time, the simulations reproduced well the experimental data of EMG envelope mean and SD as a function of mean plantarflexion torque, for the three muscles. These results suggest that the experimentally found relations between torque-EMG variability as a function of mean plantarflexion torque level depend not only on the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron pools and the muscle units innervated, but also on the increasing variability of the premotoneuronal GI spike trains when their mean rates increase to command a higher plantarflexion torque level. The simulations also provided information on spike train statistics of several hundred motoneurons that compose the triceps surae, providing a wide picture of the associated mechanisms behind torque and EMG variability.},
